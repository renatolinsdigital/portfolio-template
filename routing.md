# Handling Client-side Routing with Netlify

This website uses JavaScript to manage its routes and display the appropriate content for each URL. Since the hosting service suggested is Netlify, we need to configure the server to redirect all requests to __index.html__, allowing the JavaScript code to handle the client-side routing.

## The _redirects File

The configuration is done through the _redirects file, which contains redirect rules that tell Netlify how to handle incoming requests. In our case, the file will include the following instruction: ```/* /index.html 200```. This rule tells Netlify to redirect all requests to index.html with a 200 OK status code. The syntax of the redirect rule follows the format: <from> <to> <status code>. In this case, the <from> is /*, which matches all routes, <to> is /index.html, and <status code> is 200.

Make sure to include the _redirects file in your project when you deploy it to Netlify. This will ensure that all incoming requests are redirected to index.html, allowing your JavaScript code to handle the client-side routing and display the appropriate content for each URL.
